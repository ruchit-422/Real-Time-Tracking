1) Run the colab file 20110172_PRP_Assignment_3_.ipynb
2) The folder 'data' has the frames of the input video.
3) The folder 'answer' has the frames of the generated foregrounds using the GMM function.
4) The folder 'frames_for_comparison' has the frames of the generated foregrounds using the inbuilt function BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 in OpenCV2.
5) 'dataset.mp4' is the video for which we need to detect the foreground the remove the background.
6) The final output video of the frames that only have foreground s detected by GMM is saved as a name 'project.avi'.
